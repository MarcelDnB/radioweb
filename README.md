# Online Radio Player

## Overview
This is an online radio player that includes login/register functionality which is used to save the title of the favorites songs, that means there's a like button on page. I also included images with smooth slides which can be adjusted on one of the .php pages, the title of the song it's also animated and can also be ajusted.
For the database I used Oracle, but it can be changed in the future because I put all database scripts in 'SQL Scripts' folder.
